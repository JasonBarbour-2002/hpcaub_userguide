In-order to have AUB's matlab distributed computing cluster available in your
matlab client (i.e on your laptop/desktop/terminal), the following steps
should be followed:

   - open Matlab 2018b
   - choose ``Parallel`` > ``Discover Clusters`` and keep clicking ``Next``
     on the wizard.
   - the cluster ``matlab.aub.edu.lb`` will be available at your disposal to
     run computationally heavy tasks in paralle.

The cluster should be discoverable for computers connected to LAN or VPN.
